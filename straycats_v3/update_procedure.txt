Find the potential SL candidates:

On bifrost:

Make a new vX directtory here:

/disk/lif2/bwgref/science/stracats_vX

Make a softlink to observing_schedule.txt

cd /disk/lif2/bwgref/science/stracats_vX

ln -s /home/nustar1/Web/NuSTAROperationSite/Operations/observing_schedule.txt

This is ordered from "newest" to "oldest" from the start of the file.

Edit the start/stop sequence IDs in loop_targets_observing.py to do just the year range that you want to do. E.g.,

60802020004 is the first observation (most recent) one to do for 2022.
80601602002 is the oldest one to do for 2022

Change the outfile to be stray_light_det_vX.txt

Run loop_targets_observing.py (will take a while, recommend doing screen and running it detached).

Will produce the stray_light_det_vX.txt

Then you'll want to run the find_sl_diagnostic.ipynb

This produces a number of output text files where the SL is above expectations. Every entry will have a "??" in the SL source column to start with.




Validate and identify the SL candidates:

Start a new "merged" CSV file straycatsX_merged.csv

Start with the "strong_SL_FPMA.txt" output file and copy the information into a new CSV

For each row, go to

cd /disk/lif2/bwgref/science/stracats_vX

Copy run_sl.sh from a previous location.

Do ./run_sl.sh SEQID to generate the colormap image for this field.

If SL looks present, then do the following:

On RAN (because this requires IDL and the IDL build on bifrost is broken):

Checkout nustar_stray_light (I have this in /home/nustar1/bwgref/nustar_stray_light now)

run_sl_seqid does the "normal" SL check (BAT catalog)

run_sl_seqidv2 does the "any transient ever detected by BAT" catalog

Note that there are some tweaks that are *not* checked into github...need to fix that.

Things of note:

	Lots of 4U 1630-47
	Couple of SL sources on GRS 1915...
	Also lots of 4U 1700-377
	Unknown in 30801014002 (complicated...)
	First Sco X-1...
	Unkown in 60801024002
	Couple of new bursters
	Unkown in 60464171002
	Unknown on 30801005002

Go run find_sl_diagnostic_lvl2.ipynb and see if it turns up anything new. Can probably
just look at the jupyter notebook log.
